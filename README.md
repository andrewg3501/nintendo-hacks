if there's one thing i would love to hack, it's the nintendo wii u.
it's a classic console that has been out since November 2012, and my old one stopped working some time ago. it would be nice to have another one so i am able to hack it.
for those interested in hacking it yourself, [see here](wiiu.hacks.guide) as it is a good guide to start.
do not use video tutorials though, as they mostly tend to be outdated, lack information and can damage your console potentially.

anyways, the reason that i wanna hack the Wii U is so i can have custom firmware on it. that way, i can make modifications to games such as Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Bros 4 so i can make the game how i want it to be.
